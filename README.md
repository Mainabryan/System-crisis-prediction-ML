# System-crisis-prediction-ML
In this project, we use historical economic data from 13 African countries to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a systemic financial crisis. We clean and analyze the data, select key features like inflation rate, and train a classification model to help identify patterns that lead to major financial breakdowns.
